# Strain Gauges 2021-2022 Code

This repository has the code for the Strain Gauges custom board that our team is using during the 2021-2022 period using the MAX6675 thermocouple sensor. None external library has been used for strain measurement as it needs only ``HAL_ADC_Start_DMA`` fuction to work.

## Prerequisites

* [STM32CubeIDE ver. 1.9.0](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) and/or later
* [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) to check if the device is recognized successfully.
* STLink v.2 or any Nucleo device to succesfully flash the MCU.

## Usefull / Inspiration

* [MAX6675 library](https://github.com/Centaurus-Racing-Team/MAX31855-MAX6675-STM32) for STM32 platform using ``HAL`` drivers.
